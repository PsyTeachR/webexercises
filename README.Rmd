# The `{webexercises}` package

The goal of `{webexercises}` is to enable instructors to easily create interactive web pages that students can use in self-guided learning. Although `{webexercises}` has fewer features than RStudio's [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package, it is more lightweight: whereas `{learnr}` tutorials must be either hosted on a shiny server or run locally, `{webexercises}` creates standalone HTML files that require only a JavaScript-enabled browser. It is also extremely simple to use. See the [webexercises website](https://psyteachr.github.io/webexercises/) for demos and instructions.

## Installation

You can install `{webexercises}` from CRAN using:

```{r install-cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("webexercises")
```

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/webexercises) with:

```{r install-webexercises, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("psyteachr/webexercises")
```
